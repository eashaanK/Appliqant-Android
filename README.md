# Appliqant-Android

This is the Android application that works alongside the Node.js server I wrote for Quantilus.

## Setup
* Download the latest version of Android Studio and clone this repository. 
* Open the project and run it on a simulator or on a device. 

## Warning
You will not be able to move past the sign in screen because the app needs access to the MySQL and MongoDB databases.
To fix that, edit the MongoDB server detaials and create your own. Enter the user information based on the queries
beind made.
